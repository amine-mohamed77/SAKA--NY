## 🎯 Project Idea

Finding suitable housing is one of the biggest challenges students face when moving to a new city or starting university.  
Unihousing aims to simplify this process by connecting students with verified property owners quickly and efficiently.

- Difficulty finding rooms or apartments near the university  
- No centralized platform for student-targeted housing

Unihousing provides:
